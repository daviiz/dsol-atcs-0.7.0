/**
 * Experimental design in DSOL.
 * <p>
 * Most DSOL users find the use of the Experiment, Replication, Treatment, and ExperimentalFrame in relation to the
 * Model and the Simulator extremely difficult to use and control. The publish/subscribe mechanisms to move to a next
 * replication or event are difficult to understand, but very helpful in case different experiments or replications run
 * on different computers. As most users don't do this, the question was how to simplify the use of the experimental
 * framework.
 * <p>
 * So, what's the idea? When executing a simulation, you execute a set of Experiments on a model, using a certain
 * simulator. Different experiments will have different parameter settings for the model. Each experiment can have a
 * number of replications. Each replication has different seeds for the random number generators used, but the specified
 * parameters are the same for all replications within an experiment. An experiment has a certain runtime, warm-up time,
 * time units, and the like for execution. These are also all the same for all replications within one experiment.
 * <p>
 * The central object is therefore the <b>Experiment</b>. This is the object that links to Replications, Model, and
 * Simulator. The Replication object is an object that indicates the current replication that is being carried out. The
 * Simulator knows its Replication, and the Model now knows its simulator (change in DSOLModel). The Replication is
 * now initialized with its Experiment and not anymore with its Treatment. Treatment and Experiment are combined into
 * Experiment. The list of Replications has also been moved to the Experiment where it belongs. This makes the structure
 * more consistent. The set of Experiments to execute was called an ExperimentalFrame, but this term will be reserved
 * for the experimental frame cf. Zeigler et al. (2000) in the DSOL-DEVS formalism. he new same is ExperimentSet,
 * because it is just a set of experiments to carry out. Static helper methods have been added to help to construct an
 * ExperimentSet with one experiment with multiple replications quickly. This means that an experiment xml-file is no
 * longer necessary -- the experiment can also easily be created with a few lines of code now.
 * <p>
 * These changes mean that most models that are not extending from DSOLApplication might need a few small changes in the
 * creation and access of the Experiment, Replication, and ExperimentSet. Furthermore, all Models should now implement
 * the getSimulator() method.
 * <p>
 * The experiment xsd-file has been changed in relation to this, and the replications have been moved to the experiment
 * instead of being part of the treatment. The individual replication elements need to be surrounded by a replications
 * element. This means that experiment xml-files need to be updated as well!
 * <p>
 * Something that really caused problems when carrying out an experiment was that when building a model, there was no
 * experiment defined.
