/**
 * The SimulatorInterface defines the behavior of the simulators in the DSOL framework. The simulator is defined as the
 * computational object capable of executing the model. The simulator is therefore an object which must can be stopped, paused,
 * started, reset, etc.<br>
 * <br>
 * The START_REPLICATION_EVENT, WARMUP_EVENT, and END_REPLICATION_EVENT are fired exactly one time per replication. Note that
 * the WARMUP_EVENT is fired right after the START_REPLICATION_EVENT when the warmup time is zero. The START_EVENT, STOP_EVENT
 * and STEP_EVENT should only be fired between the start of the replication and the end of the replication. The START_EVENT and
 * STEP_EVENT should only be fired when the simulator is stopped; the STOP_EVENT should only be fired when the simulator is
 * running.
